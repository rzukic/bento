## Unreleased

_Changes that are complete but not yet part of a versioned release._

## Phase 1 — Foundation

### 2026-04-05 — Complete backend API server foundation and align docs with implemented routes

> **Phase**: Phase 1 — Foundation
> **Working step**: [Step 1.3 — Backend API Server (Routing, Middleware, Error Handling)](working-steps/1.3-backend-api-server.md)

Completed the Step 1.3 backend server foundation on `dev` and cleaned the docs so implemented behavior is clearly separated from planned Phase 1+ features. The API/docs now reflect the real current contract: middleware, runtime config, request tracing, and `/api/v1/admin/health` are real; auth, CRUD, query, and WebSocket pieces are still future work.

**Highlights:**
- Backend host composition, middleware stack, and reserved versioned route areas are implemented in Step 1.3
- `/api/v1/admin/health` is the canonical health endpoint with request-id and operational metadata
- API/backend/architecture docs now explicitly mark auth, CRUD, query, DDL blocklist, and WebSocket behavior as not yet implemented where applicable

### 2026-04-03 — Core database connection and query builder

> **Phase**: Phase 1 — Foundation
> **Working step**: [Step 1.1 — Core database connection & query builder](working-steps/1.1-core-database-connection-and-query-builder.md)

Starting the foundational database layer — .NET project scaffolding, dual connection pool architecture (system + data pools), query builder abstraction with SqlKata + Dapper, column type system, and namespace isolation with system table bootstrap.

**Highlights:**
- Project scaffolding with ASP.NET Core and all required NuGet dependencies
- Dual connection pool architecture for security isolation (R1.8)
- Query builder wrapping SqlKata + Dapper for Postgres and SQLite
- Column type system with 12 types and cross-dialect mappings
- System table bootstrap with idempotent first-run setup
